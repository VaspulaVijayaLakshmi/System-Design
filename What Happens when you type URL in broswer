What happens when you type google .com into a browser?

1 - First up, you type the website address in the browser’s address bar.
2 - The browser checks its cache first. If there’s a cache miss, it must find the IP address.
3 - DNS lookup begins . The request goes through different DNS servers (root, TLD, and authoritative). Finally, the IP address is retrieved.

4 - Next, your browser initiates a TCP connection like a handshake. 
For example, in the case of HTTP 1.1, the client and server perform a TCP three-way handshake with SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK messages.


5 - Once the handshake is successful, the browser makes an HTTP request to the server and the server responds with HTML, CSS, and JS files.
6 - Finally, the browser processes everything. It parses the HTML document and creates DOM.
7 - The browser executes the JavaScript and renders the page 
8 - Finally, the webpage appears on your screen.
