ACTIVE - PASSIVE or StandBy
Standby servers (replicas) are configured to replicate data from the primary. They continuously receive a stream of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records generated by the primary.

As the standby receives WAL entries, it replays and applies them in real-time to update its own data files and maintain an almost exact copy of the primary database.
