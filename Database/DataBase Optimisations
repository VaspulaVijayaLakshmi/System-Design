What Makes Databases Durable (Even After Crashes)?

WAL - write ahead log - durable  Sequential file log  -  which records DB operations sequentially
                                         In the event of crash, this can be replayed to get back to the state 
                                        Db state.


Checkpointing - add checkpoints in db to flush the db state to disk, cause overtime this WAL grows.
                            And its tome consuming to replay so much…
