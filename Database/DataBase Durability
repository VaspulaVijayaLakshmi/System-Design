Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

Checkpointing

Replication


Durability : 
Whether the database server crashes, restarts, or there’s a sudden power outage, you can trust that your committed data won’t simply disappear.


Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):
It gives the database a persistent, chronological record of every change, which can later be replayed to recover the exact state after a crash.
