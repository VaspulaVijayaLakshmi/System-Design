LEts say we want to set an expiration on key

to do manually.
We can have a cron job that runs periodically.That updated .

so when inserting we also insert the Creation time column
and we will have ttl.

We can run something like

Delete * from db where creation time - now() > = ttl


Lets say the cron job hadn't run yet and client accesses the key.

then we need to have this check in the client query everytime where creation - now() <= ttl, then only return.

But this operqtion is expensive we need to do it everytime - creation time - now() 


So we can do soft delete, when jpob runs, we can mark the column is_expired as true, and when the traffic downtime is less we can run other jobs to delete the keys.


now do we really need a new column is_expired, we can have something like, when cron job runs , it can mark expired keys as expired data to -1.
When accessing we simply check if_ecpired !=-1




Also in INSERTION IN KVstore


SO when inserting do we retreive the kets
With select then update those columns?

with those value?


We can simply do Upset query.

UPSERT -> INSERT + UPDATE
Insert if not exists and update if existss.
