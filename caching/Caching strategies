Read-Through Cache: The application first checks the cache for data. If it's not there (a cache miss), it retrieves the data from the database and updates the cache.



Write-Through Cache: Data is written to both the cache and the database simultaneously, ensuring consistency but potentially impacting write performance.
The biggest advantage of Write Through is that it ensures strong data consistency between the cache and the database.




Write-Back Cache: Data is written to the cache first and later synchronized with the database, improving write performance but risking data loss.

Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): The application is responsible for reading and writing from both the cache and the database.



Write Around is a caching strategy where data is written directly to the database, bypassing the cache.
The cache is only updated when the data is requested later during a read operation, at which point the Cache Aside strategy is used to load the data into the cache.
