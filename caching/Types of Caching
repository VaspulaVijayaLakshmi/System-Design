In-Memory Cache:

In-memory caches store data in the main memory (RAM) for extremely fast access.
These caches are typically used for session management, storing frequently accessed objects, and as a front for databases.
Examples: Redis and Memcached.



Database Cache:
Database caching involves storing frequently queried database results in a cache.
This reduces the number of queries made to the database, improving performance and scalability.



Content Delivery Network (CDN)
CDN is used to store copies of content on servers distributed across different geographical locations.
This reduces latency by serving content from a server closer to the user.



Client-Side Cache
Client-side caching involves storing data on the client device, typically in the form of cookies, local storage, or application-specific caches.
This is commonly used in web browsers to cache static assets like images, scripts, and stylesheets.



Distributed Cache:
