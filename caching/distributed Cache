Distributed caching is a technique where cache data is stored across multiple nodes (servers) instead of being confined to a single machine.

This allows the cache to scale horizontally and accommodate the needs of large-scale applications.


1. Scalability
Distributed caching allows applications to scale horizontally by adding more cache nodes.
This helps manage more traffic without a significant drop in performance.



2. Fault Tolerance
Since data is spread across multiple nodes, the failure of a single node doesn’t result in the loss of the entire cache.
Remaining nodes can continue to serve requests allowing the system to recover gracefully.


3. Load Balancing
By distributing the cache across several nodes, the load is spread evenly.
This helps prevent any single node becoming a bottleneck.







1. Cache Nodes: These are the individual servers where the cache data is stored. Each node is a part of the overall cache cluster.

2. Client Library/Cache Client: Applications use a client library to talk to the distributed cache. 
This library handles the logic of connecting to cache nodes, distributing data, and retrieving cached data.

3. Consistent Hashing: This method spreads data evenly across cache nodes. 
It ensures that adding or removing nodes has minimal impact on the system.

4. Replication: To make the system more reliable, some distributed caches replicate data across multiple nodes. 
If one node goes down, the data is still available on another.

5. Sharding: Data is split into shards, and each shard is stored on a different cache node. 
It helps distribute the data evenly and allows the cache to scale horizontally.

6. Eviction Policies: Caches implement eviction policies like LRU (Least Recently Used), 
LFU (Least Frequently Used), or TTL (Time to Live) to get rid of old or less-used data and make space for new data.


7. Coordination and Synchronization: Coordination mechanisms like distributed locks or consensus protocols ensure that cache nodes remain synchronized, 
especially when multiple nodes try to change the same data at the same time.



8. Cache Invalidation: To keep the cache data in sync with the primary data source, it needs to be invalidated or updated periodically. 
Cache systems implement strategies like time-based expiration or event-based expiration for cache invalidation.







How Does Distributed Caching Work?


1. Data Distribution: When data is cached, the client library typically hashes the key associated with the data to determine which cache node will store it.

2. Data Retrieval: To get data from the cache, application provides the key to the client library.
The client library uses this key to find and query the node which has the data. If the data is present (a cache hit), 
it’s returned to the application. If not (a cache miss), the data is fetched from the primary data store (e.g., a database), and it can be cached for future use.
