In-memory versus disk-based caches differ by storage location.

In-memory caches store data in RAM, providing extremely fast access with low latency (microseconds to milliseconds).
Storage is volatile: data is lost on restart unless persistence is enabled. 
Use in-memory caches for real-time applications requiring high-speed access. Examples: Redis, Memcached.




Disk-based caches store data on persistent storage like hard drives or SSDs. 
Data persists through restarts, ideal for long-term cacheable data storage.
They're slower than in-memory caches due to disk I/O latency. 
Use disk-based caches for large datasets or static assets where persistence matters more than speed.





-> Client-side versus server-side caches differ by location in architecture.

Client-side caches store data on user devices (browsers or apps). 
They reduce server communication by caching locally and are specific to individual users,enabling faster responses for repeated requests. 

Use client-side caches for static assets or user-specific data in offline-capable applications. 
Examples: Browser Cache, LocalStorage, IndexedDB.



Server-side caches store data on or near servers, shared across all users and requests.
They reduce load on backend systems like databases and APIs and optimize performance for high-traffic applications serving shared data quickly. 
Use server-side caches for frequently accessed data consistent across users like API responses, product pages, or popular posts.
