Best Practices for Implementing Distributed Caching/ CAching


To get the most out of your distributed caching system, consider the following best practices:

Cache Judiciously: Not all data benefits from caching. Focus on frequently accessed, relatively static data.

Set Appropriate TTLs: Use Time-To-Live (TTL) values to automatically expire cached data and reduce staleness.

Implement Cache-Aside Pattern: Load data into the cache only when it's requested, to avoid unnecessary caching.

Monitor and Tune: Regularly monitor cache hit rates, memory usage, and network traffic to optimize performance.

Plan for Failure: Design your system to gracefully handle cache node failures without significant impact on the application.

Implement Cache Warming: Develop strategies to pre-populate critical data in the cache to avoid cold starts.
