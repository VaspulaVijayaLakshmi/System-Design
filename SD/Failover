Failover is the ability to switch automatically and seamlessly to a reliable backup system. When a component or primary system fails,
either a standby operational mode or redundancy should achieve failover .


Failover automation in servers includes pulse or heartbeat conditions. That is, heartbeat cables connect two servers or
multiple servers in a network with the primary server always active. As long as the heartbeat continues or it perceives the pulse, the secondary server merely rests.

However, should the secondary server perceive any change in the pulse from the primary failover server, it will initiate its instances and
take over the primary serverâ€™s operation.



Active-active and active-passive y are the most common configurations for high availability (HA).


ACTIVE - ACTIVE :

Typically, at least two nodes actively working simultaneously 

The active-active cluster distributes workloads across all the nodes more evenly, preventing any single node from overloading and achieving load balancing. 
And because more nodes remain available, throughput and response times improve. To ensure the HA cluster operates seamlessly and achieves redundancy,




ACTIVE PASSIVE :

 active-passive cluster, although there must be at least two nodes, not all of them are active. 
In a two node system with the first node active, the second node will remain passive or on standby as the failover server.
In this standby operational mode, it can remain ready should the active, primary server stop functioning to serve as a backup. 

However, unless there is a failure, clients only connect to the active server.
