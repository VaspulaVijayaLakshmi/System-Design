Load Balancer is a system that spreads incoming network traffic across multiple backend 
servers (often called “worker nodes” or “application servers”).


Types of Load Balancers

Software Load Balancer: Runs on standard servers or virtual machines 
(e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, Envoy). 



Layer 4 (Transport Layer): Distributes traffic based on network information like IP 
address and port. It doesn’t inspect the application-layer data (HTTP, HTTPS headers)

Layer 7 (Application Layer): Can make distribution decisions based on HTTP headers, 
cookies, URL path, etc. 



Load Balancing Algorithms:

1. Round Robin: Requests are distributed sequentially to each server in a loop.

2. Weighted Round Robin: Each server is assigned a weight (priority). 
Servers with higher weights receive proportionally more requests.

3. Least Connections: The request goes to the server with the fewest active connections.

4. IP Hash: The load balancer uses a hash of the client’s IP to always route them to the
same server (useful for sticky sessions).

5. Random: Select a server randomly (sometimes used for quick prototypes or specialized cases).







Server Health Checks
Load balancers usually have an internal mechanism to periodically check if servers are alive 
(e.g., by sending a heartbeat request like an HTTP GET /health).

If a server doesn’t respond within a certain threshold, it’s marked as unhealthy and 
no longer receives traffic.

When it recovers, the load balancer can automatically reintroduce it into the rotation.
