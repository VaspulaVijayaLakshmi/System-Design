Rate limiting helps protects services from being overwhelmed by too many requests
from a single user or client.


Token Bucket

Every start of the time interval we fill he bucket will tokens(max token in time interval - capcity), 
if tokens are there we process the reuqetss
else discard.

Tokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate (e.g., 10 tokens per second).

When a request arrives, it must obtain a token from the bucket to proceed.




Leaky Bucket : 

The buckets has max capacity, it  fills at regular intervals with requests 
and if its filled, we drop new requests.

1.Imagine a bucket with a small hole in the bottom.

2.Requests enter the bucket from the top.

3.The bucket processes ("leaks") requests at a constant rate through the hole.

4.If the bucket is full, new requests are discarded.



Fixed Window : 

Theres are fixed time  windows 
SO in tht window the users can max requests k requests...



so lets say the interval is 100 req for 5sec
we may not gt requests regulary at the edge of 4sec we may get 100res at once
and next window starting we mayget 100 req...

the system will be overwhlemend like this....


this is known as Burst at edges.....





Sliding WIndow : 


The window slides , at each window there should be at max,  10 reqs.
SO we slide and the window consisys of 5sec, on 6th sec, we slide the window and go to next  5 mins, laving the 1min

...in this way not busts happens.
