In distributed systems, a heartbeat is a periodic message sent from one component to another to monitor each other's health and status.

Without a heartbeat mechanism, it's hard to quickly detect failures in a distributed system, leading to:

Delayed fault detection and recovery

Increased downtime and errors




Heartbeats can help with:

Monitoring: Heartbeat messages help in monitoring the health and status of different parts of a distributed system.

Detecting Failures: Heartbeats enable a system to identify when a component becomes unresponsive. 
If a node misses several expected heartbeats, it's a sign that something might be wrong.


Triggering Recovery Actions: Heartbeats allow the system to take corrective actions.
This could mean moving tasks to a healthy node, restarting a failed component, 




Load Balancing: By monitoring the heartbeats of different nodes, 
a load balancer can distribute tasks more effectively across the network based on the responsiveness and health of each node.






The heartbeat mechanism involves two primary components:

Heartbeat sender (Node): This is the node that sends periodic heartbeat signals.

Heartbeat receiver (Monitor): This component receives and monitors the heartbeat signals.










Frequency: How often should heartbeats be sent? There needs to be a balance. 
If they're sent too often, they'll use up too much network resources.
If they're sent too infrequently, it might take longer to detect problems.



Timeout: How long should a node wait before it considers another node 'dead'?
This depends on expected network latency and application needs. 
If it's too quick, it might mistake a live node for a dead one, 
and if it's too slow, it might take longer to recover from problems.



SOmetims the node may not be down, it migt be little overwhelmed and may respond slowly.





Payload: Heartbeats usually just contain a little bit of information like a timestamp or sequence number.
But, they can also carry additional data like how much load a node is currently handling, health metrics, or version information.


This enables the loadbalcner or api gateway to take more intelligent routing decisions.









Types of Heartbeats
There are two primary types of heartbeats:

Push heartbeats: Nodes actively send heartbeat signals to the monitor.

Pull heartbeats: The monitor periodically queries nodes for their status
