Imagine you're making a purchase from an online store.
You hit "pay" but the screen freezes, and you're unsure if the payment went through.
So, you refresh the page and try again.

Behind the scenes, how does the system ensure you aren’t accidentally charged twice?


This scenario highlights a common problem in distributed systems: handling repeated operations gracefully.

The solution to this problem lies in the concept of idempotency.



IDEMPOTENCY : 

In mathematics, an operation is idempotent if applying it multiple times produces the same result 
as applying it once.

Eg: the absolute value function is idempotent: ||-5|| = |-5| = 5.
Eg:  setting a value is idempotent, while incrementing a value is not.




Why Idempotency Matters ?


Distributed systems often require fault tolerance to ensure high availability.
When a network issue causes a timeout or an error, the client might retry the request.

If the system handles retries without idempotency, every retry could change the 
system’s state unpredictably.




Strategies to Implement Idempotency:


When a client makes a request, it generates a unique ID that the server uses to track the request.
If the server receives a request with the same ID later, it knows it’s a duplicate and discards it.





from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import sqlite3

app Flask(__name__)
# Initialize SQLite connection


def get_db():
conn sqlite3.connect('database.db')
return conn



@app.route('/process_payment', methods=['POST'])
def process_payment();
request_id request.headers.get("Request-ID")
db get_db()
cursor db.cursor()


# Check if request_id already processed
cursor.execute("SELECT 1 FROM processed_requests WHERE request_id = ?", (request_id,))
if cursor.fetchone():
return jsonify({"message": "Duplicate request ignored"}), 200


# Process payment
#Here you would include your payment processing logic
print("Processing payment...")


#Mark request as processed
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO processed_requests (request_id) VALUES (?)", (request_id,)) db.commit()
return jsonify({"message": "Payment processed successfully"}), 200


if __name__ == '__main__':
app.run (debug=True)









DB Operatin : 

Some database operations, such as inserting the same record multiple times,
can lead to unintended duplicate entries.

Achieving idempotency in these cases often requires redesigning 
the database operations to be inherently idempotent.

This can involve using upsert operations (which updates a record if it exists or inserts it otherwise)
or applying unique constraints that prevent duplicates from being added in the first place.
