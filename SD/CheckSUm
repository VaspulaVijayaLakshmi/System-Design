The process of using a checksum for error detection is straightforward:

Calculation: Before sending or storing data, the original data is processed through a specific algorithm to produce a checksum value.

Transmission/Storage: The checksum is appended to the data and sent over the network or saved in storage.

Verification: Upon retrieval or reception, the checksum is recalculated using the same algorithm on the received data. This newly calculated checksum is compared with the original checksum.

Error Detection: If the two checksum values match, the data is considered intact. If they do not match, it indicates that
the data has been altered or corrupted during transmission or storage.





ENcryption ALgorithms : 


SHA, MD5 encryption algos





File downloads: Checksums verify that downloaded files are complete and uncorrupted.

Data backups: Checksums ensure that backed-up data is accurate and trustworthy.

Network communication: Checksums guarantee that data packets are transmitted correctly, preventing errors and corruption.
