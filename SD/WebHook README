IN websockets we have the connections open but we still haave mesage queue why?
Because msgs are send istantly

but what if recipient is offline?


Even with persistent WebSocket connections, you still need a message queue to handle things WebSockets don’t solve:


1. Reliability and Persistence
WebSocket alone is ephemeral — if the server restarts or crashes, any messages not yet sent to clients are lost.

Message Queues persist messages until they're processed, ensuring nothing gets dropped.

Example: A chat message is sent to a server, but the recipient is briefly disconnected. If the message was only in WebSocket memory — poof! 
With a queue (e.g., Kafka), it’s buffered and safely delivered when possible.




2. Asynchronous Processing & Decoupling
Message producers (e.g., a user sending a chat) shouldn’t care who’s connected.

Queues allow decoupling:
→ One service sends messages to the queue.
→ Another service (e.g., WebSocket server) pulls and pushes it to connected clients.



3. Backpressure Handling
If too many messages come in too fast, WebSocket connections may get overwhelmed.

A queue acts as a buffer that allows the system to catch up gracefully.


4. Replay & History
Queues like Kafka can retain messages for hours/days.

You can replay missed messages (e.g., user opens the app and syncs recent messages from the last 24 hours).



5. Fan-out / Pub-Sub Use Case
One user sends a message → should go to multiple recipients.

Queue makes it easy to implement fan-out (send to N subscribers).
