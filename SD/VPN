A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a secure connection over the internet that 
encrypts your data and hides your IP address, offering a more private and secure 
online experience. It essentially creates a private tunnel between your device and a remote
server, protecting your data from eavesdropping and allowing you to bypass geo-restrictions. 




How it Works:

Encryption:
When you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is encrypted .


"internet traffic" refers to the data that's sent and received across the internet when you are using your device.


IP Address Masking:
Your real IP address is hidden, and instead, the VPN server's IP address is displayed 
to websites and services, making it harder to track your location. 


Secure Tunnel:
The VPN creates a secure, private tunnel between your device and the VPN server,
protecting your data from prying eyes.
