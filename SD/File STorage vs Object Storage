File storage divides the file into fixed sized blocks and these are written to disk.

Managing unstructured data or big data can be hard to handle with this storage
ALso limited metadata: this only stores, the timestamp and user owner.....



Object STorage:

This stores Data in the as objects ina FLAT structure.

[Data : binary Data]
[object Id : string]
[metadata : {key val pairs}]





[object Id : 1sdj]
[object Id : 2edf4]
[object Id : ddfr]

Object are stored like this to make the retrival easier instead of complex HHigharchy document struture.


Highly scalable
Rich metadata
Big Data



Usage : Netflic and utube media content.
