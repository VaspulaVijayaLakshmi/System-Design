An access token :  is utilized by the Client to access the Resource Ownerâ€™s data. 
The Authorization Server issues the access token to the Client after proper authentication and authorization. 
The Client uses the access token to request the Resource Server.




A refresh token:  replaces the previous access token when it expires without requiring the Resource Owner to re-authenticate.
The refresh token is usually issued along with the access token and employed when the access token becomes invalid.



Thats the reason - in insmnia we need to keep replacing Bearer token
Web Browser requests  we dont need to use Bearer token  because, it is replaced by refresh tojen.
