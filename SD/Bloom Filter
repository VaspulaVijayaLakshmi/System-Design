Have you ever wondered how Netflix knows which shows you've already watched?  
How Amazon avoids showing you products you've already purchased?

Using a traditional data structure like a hash table for these checks could consume significant amount of memory,
especially with millions of users and items.

Instead, many systems rely on a more efficient data structure—a Bloom Filter



BLOOM FILTER : BLOOM filter is a probabilistic DS, which tell if the elemeent mabne present in set.

Its useful when we need fastlookups,  and less memory , and occasinal 
FALSE POSITIVES are managable.







KEY COMPONENTS  :

1. Bit Array :  bit array of a fixed size, initialized to all zeros. 
This array represents whether certain elements are in the set.


2.Hash Function : Set of has functions, each of which are responsible for a part of array.
                  These map each element  to array indices.      





How Does a Bloom Filter Work?


You have k hash functions
Each hash function maps the key → one index (0 … m-1) in the bit array
You set those k bit positions to 1

Example:

bit array size = 10
hash1(key) → 2
hash2(key) → 6
hash3(key) → 9

Set bits at indices {2, 6, 9}

Lookup

Run the same k hash functions
Check those k indices:

If any bit = 0 → definitely not present
If all bits = 1 → maybe present (false positive possible)


Interview one-liner:
In a Bloom filter, multiple hash functions map a key to multiple bit-array indices.





Using a Bloom Filter for URL Checking:

Step 1: Set Up the Bloom Filter
Initialize a Bit Array: Let’s assume our Bloom Filter uses a bit array of size 10, 
initially all set to 0.


Choose Hash Functions: We’ll use two hash functions in this example. 
These hash functions take an input (like a URL) and output an index in the bit array.



public class BloomFilter {
private final BitSet bitArray;
private final int size;


private final Function<String, Integer> [] hashFunctions;


public BloomFilter (int size, Function<String, Integer>... hashFunctions) {
this.size = size;
this.bitArray = new BitSet(size);
this.hashFunctions = hashFunctions;
}


// Method to add an element to the Bloom Filter
public void add (String item) {
for (Function<String, Integer> hashFunction: hashFunctions) {
int index = Math.abs(hashFunction.apply(item) % size);
bitArray.set(index);
}
}



// Method to check if an element is possibly in the Bloom Filter
public boolean mightContain(String item) {
for (Function<String, Integer> hashFunction hashFunctions) {
int index = Math.abs(hashFunction.apply(item) % size);
if (!bitArray.get(index)) {
return false; // If any bit is 0, the item is definitely not in the
set
}
}
return true; // All bits are 1, so the item is probably in the set
}
}




Web Caching : 

1. USED FOR CACHE SEARCH

Problem: Web servers often cache frequently accessed pages or resources to improve response times.
However, checking the cache for every resource could become costly and slow as the cache grows.

Solution: A Bloom Filter can be used to quickly check if a URL might be in the cache. 
When a request arrives, the Bloom Filter is checked first. If the Bloom Filter indicates the URL
is “probably in the cache,” a cache lookup is performed.

If it indicates the URL is “definitely not in the cache,” the server skips the cache lookup and
fetches the resource from the primary storage, saving time and resources.



2. Spam Filtering in Email Systems

 Email systems need to filter out spam emails without constantly 
checking large spam databases.

 Bloom Filter can store hashes of known spam email addresses. 
When a new email arrives, the Bloom Filter checks if the sender's address might be in the spam list.

This allows the email system to quickly determine whether an email is likely to be spam or legitimate.





3.NETFLIX : Not recomending watched mocies/series again

4.AMAZON : notrecommneding same products  again

5. Social Network Friend Recommendations : Dont show frnds who are already frnds..so the ones we said not to reccomend

6.DATABASES : Databases, especially distributed ones, often need to check if a key exists before accessing or 
modifying data. Performing these checks for every key directly in the database can be slow.

Many databases, such as Cassandra, HBase, and Redis, use Bloom Filters to avoid unnecessary disk lookups for non-existent keys.
The Bloom Filter quickly checks if a key might be present. If the Bloom Filter indicates “not present,” 
it can skip the database lookup.





Limitations of Bloom Filters

1. False Positives : Over time there could be hash collisions, and it increases the chances
             of false posiitves

Consider a scenario where a non-existent key is checked against a Bloom Filter.
If all the hash functions map to bits that are already set to 1, the filter falsely 
signals the presence of the key.

This may lead to unneccsary processing.

For instance, in a database system, this might trigger unnecessary cache lookups 
or wasted attempts to fetch data that doesn’t actually exist.


2.  Not Suitable for Exact Set Membership

3.Vulnerable to Hash Collisions

4. No Support for Deletions
Standard Bloom Filters do not support element deletions. Once a bit is set to 1 by adding an element,
it cannot be unset because other elements may also rely on that bit.

This limitation makes Bloom Filters unsuitable for dynamic sets where elements are frequently added and
removed.
