Push Architecture:


In a push architecture, data or updates are sent from a central server or source to clients as soon as they become available.

The server initiates the communication, pushing information to clients without waiting for a specific request.

Examples
1. Notifications Systems: Mobile push notifications that alert users to new messages, updates, or events.

2. Live Feeds: Real-time data feeds like stock market tickers or social media updates.


Advantages
1. Timely Updates: Ensures clients receive the latest information immediately, which is critical for real-time applications.

2. Reduced Latency: Minimizes the delay between data availability and client reception.

3. Efficient Resource Utilization: Reduces unnecessary network traffic and server load caused by frequent polling.




PULL Architecture:


In a pull architecture, clients request data or updates from the server as needed.

The client initiates the communication, pulling information from the server when it requires specific data.

Client Control: Clients have more control over when and what data they receive, reducing unnecessary data transfers.



WHen to use what?'



Choose push architecture:

Building real-time or near-real-time systems (e.g., live dashboards, instant messaging)

Dealing with time-sensitive data (e.g., stock prices, emergency alerts)





Choose Pull Architecture When:


Building systems that can tolerate some delay in data updates

Working with stable, predictable data sources

Implementing systems where receivers need to control their data intake.
