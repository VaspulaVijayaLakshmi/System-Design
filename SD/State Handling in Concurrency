State handling in concurrent systems 


It’s not about writing a multithreaded program that just runs.
It’s about ensuring CORRECTNESS under load, where multiple threads read and modify shared state.
It's about ensuring you still get good PERFORMANCE along with correctness.




1. Immutable state is your friend: 
- If something doesn’t need to change, make it immutable. You just removed a whole class of race conditions.

2. Shared mutable state needs discipline: 
- Locks, atomics, synchronized blocks - use them, but wisely.
- Over-locking kills performance. Under-locking kills correctness.

3. Design for consistency, not hacks
- Example: in a cache with expiry, two threads racing to update expiry state should not corrupt the map. You need well-thought-out synchronization strategies.

4. Test under concurrency, not sequentially
- Code that looks fine in single-threaded tests often breaks spectacularly under concurrent load. 
- Use load tests, randomized schedulers to find bugs.

At scale, concurrency isn’t just about threads; it’s about designing state flow so that correctness and performance can co-exist.

This is the kind of deep, hands-on problem-solving we do in my Multithreading/HLD courses - not just theory, but real-world scenarios that show up in interviews and production.
