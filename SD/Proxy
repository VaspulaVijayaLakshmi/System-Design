Proxy 


Proxies and reverse proxies are servers that sit between clients and servers to 
improve security, privacy and performance.


A Proxy server (sometimes called a Forward proxy) acts on behalf of clients,
while a Reverse Proxy acts on behalf of servers.



Forward Proxy :

Think of proxy server as a middleman that sits between a private network(user/client) and the public internet.

user makes req - proxy intercepts it -> fowards it to target server..->retur response

Privacy and Anonymity: Proxy servers hide your IP address by using their own, 
so the destination server cannot know your real location or identity.

Access Control: Organizations use proxies to enforce content restrictions, monitor internet usage.
Target Laptop - u cant visit few sites.


Security: Proxies can filter out malicious content and block suspicious sites, 
providing an additional layer of security.

Improved Performance: Proxies cache frequently accessed content, reducing latency 
and improving load times for websites.










What is a Reverse Proxy?

It sits in front of servers, intercepts client requests and forwards them to backend servers 


Think of a reverse proxy as a gatekeeper. Instead of hiding clients from the 
server, it hides servers from clients.

Allowing direct access to servers can pose security risks, exposing them to threats like hackers and DDoS attacks.

A reverse proxy mitigates these risks by creating a single, controlled point of entry that filters and 
regulates incoming traffic all while keeping server IP addresses hidden.


Cloudflare’s reverse proxy is widely used by global websites and applications to boost speed, 
security, and reliability.



Key Benefits of Reverse Proxy
Enhanced Security: 

Load Balancing:  

Caching Static Content: Reverse proxies can cache static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript, 
reducing the need to fetch these files from the backend repeatedly.

SSL Termination: Reverse proxies can handle SSL encryption, offloading this work from backend servers.





When a server goes down, a  proxy typically implements a mechanism 
to handle the failure and gracefully respond to client requests


Retry mechanisms

Load Balancing - sending the req to another server

Health check - heartbeat mechanism

Error handling 











Is a VPN the same as a Proxy?
No. While both hide your IP, a VPN encrypts all your internet traffic, making it more secure. 
A proxy only forwards specific requests without necessarily encrypting them.
