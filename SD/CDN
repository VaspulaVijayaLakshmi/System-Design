CDN - content delivery network

Used in video streaming platforms/ online gaming where the latency should be minimal. 

Because loading heavy videos with high qualties take so much of network bandwidth.
And users would be frustrated with buffering ....



Users in distant regions experience significant latency, slow load times, and frustrating buffering issue
The farther they are from your server, the longer it takes for data to travel across the network, degrading their experience.



 you need a way to bring your content physically closer to your users, reducing the distance data must travel.


Thats exactly what CDNs are needed for
they serve from the nearest geographic locations possible.


CDN is a geograhically distributed network of servers working together to serve the static media to users from nearest location possible.
