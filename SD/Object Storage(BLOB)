Object storage:



Stores data as objects = {data + metadata + unique ID}.
Flat structure (no folders).
Scalable, durable, good for unstructured data like images, videos, backups.
Access via HTTP APIs (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob).

Use when: need high durability + huge scale, not frequent updates.


Objects live in buckets using unique keys.

Blob storage:
“Blob” = Binary Large Object.



Object storage systems use RESTful APIs for storing, retrieving, or deleting objects. 
The systems scale horizontally by adding servers and distributing objects automatically. They handle massive data volumes.


Data replicates across multiple servers or regions, ensuring high durability even when nodes fail.


Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is scalable, secure, and durable object storage from AWS. It's the most widely used object storage in the industry.
Google Cloud Storage is flexible, fully managed object storage from Google Cloud.
Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution in Azure.


Storage Account (or Project)
 └── Bucket
      └── Object (key)



EG:
```
bucket-name/
 └── images/
      └── 2025/
           └── profile.png
```

This will be actually stored as one object key:

```
object key = "images/2025/profile.png"
```

Why object storage has no real hierarchy

Designed for scale
Billions of objects

A directory tree would become a bottleneck
Flat namespace → easy to distribute across nodes

Fast lookups
Object is fetched by key
No need to traverse folders (/a/b/c)
One hash lookup → direct access
