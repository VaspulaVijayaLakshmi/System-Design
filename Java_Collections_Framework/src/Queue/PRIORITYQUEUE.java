//Queues store elements in a FIFO manner, while Deques allow operations at both ends. They are used for scheduling


//A PriorityQueue in Java is a queue where elements are ordered based on their priority,
// rather than the order of insertion. By default, it uses natural ordering (min-heap), but a custom comparator can be used to define different priorities.

//Supports standard queue operations like add(), poll(), and peek().
//Automatically grows as elements are added.
//Uses a heap data structure internally to ensure efficient insertion and removal of the highest-priority element.


//PriorityQueue<Integer> p = new PriorityQueue<>();
