//    In Java, a Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle and is defined in the java.util package.
//    Internally, it extends the Vector class.

//    Stack class maintains insertion order
//    Grows dynamically when its capacity is exceeded.
//All the methods of Stack are synchronized. It is thread-safe - since its extends Vector

//    Stack class implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, and Serializable interfaces.



    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>()

            empty(),peek(),pop(),push()


//    stak extends Vector and adds all fucntionality like push,pop,top,isEmpty
//    hence it is lecacy now, because of poor design

    //we can use dequeus
}
