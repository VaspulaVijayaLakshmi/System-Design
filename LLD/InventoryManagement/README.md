An inventory management system is designed to efficiently track, manage, and optimize product inventory within a business. 
The system needs to handle multiple products, track stock levels, process orders, and ensure timely replenishment. 
The system should be able to accommodate different product types, handle various inventory operations, and provide accurate reporting.


Setup:
• The business has multiple warehouses and can store multiple product types.
• Products can be added, removed, or transferred between warehouses.
• Each product has attributes like SKU(Stock Keeping Unit - Unique Id of a Product), name, price, and quantity.
• The system tracks inventory levels and triggers alerts for low stock.


Operation:

• Users can add new products to the inventory.
• Stock levels are updated when products are received or shipped.
• The system generates reports on inventory status and movement.
• Inventory can be searched and filtered based on various criteria.



Safety Features:

• Threshold alerts prevent stockouts.
• Audit trails track all inventory changes.
• Access control limits who can perform different inventory operations.
