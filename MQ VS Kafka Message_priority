RabbitMQ (supports message priority natively)

RabbitMQ has priority queues built-in.

How:
When declaring a queue, you set a x-max-priority argument.
Each message can have a priority field (0–10 for example).
Broker automatically delivers higher-priority messages first.


RabbitMQ internally keeps messages sorted by priority → higher ones get consumed first.




Kafka (no native priority queue)

Kafka doesn’t natively support message priorities because it’s a log-based system (append-only ordered by offset).
Ways to handle it anyway:

Option 1: Separate Topics by Priority
topic-high-priority
topic-normal
topic-low-priority

Consumer logic:
Poll high-priority topic first → then normal → then low.
Very common and scalable approach.  




Option 2: Priority Embedded in Message

Include priority in the message itself.
Consumer reads a batch → sorts messages by priority → processes high first.  




Standard SQS doesn’t have built-in priority, but you can:

Use multiple queues (high, medium, low),
Use a dispatcher service that polls high first.
