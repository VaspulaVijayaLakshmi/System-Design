Elasticsearch is a powerful search engine that excels in full-text search, complex query execution, 
and handling high-volume traffic efficiently. 


At its core, Elasticsearch operates using inverted indexes, a key feature that makes it highly 
efficient for search operations.

Inverted indexes allow Elasticsearch to quickly locate and retrieve data by mapping each unique
word to the documents or records it appears in, significantly speeding up search queries.
