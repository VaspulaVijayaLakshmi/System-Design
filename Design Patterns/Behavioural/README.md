Behavioral patterns are concerned with object interaction, communication, and responsibility.
They define how objects behave and interact at runtime to achieve a task.

| Pattern                     | Intent / Purpose                                                                                                 | Example / Use Case                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observer**                | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. Observers are notified automatically when the subject changes. | YouTube subscriptions, Event listeners            |
| **Strategy**                | Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms and lets the client select one at runtime.                               | Payment methods (CreditCard, PayPal, UPI)         |
| **Template Method**         | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.                            | Sorting algorithms, Game loop skeleton            |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it.                                                  | Logging frameworks, Event handling                |
| **Mediator**                | Centralizes communication between objects to reduce coupling.                                                    | Chatroom apps, Air traffic control simulation     |
| **Iterator**                | Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.                | Traversing a list, tree, or graph                 |
| **State**                   | Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.                                         | TCP connection states, Media player states        |
