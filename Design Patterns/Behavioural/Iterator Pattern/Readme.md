Lets say we have a playlist

or anykind of iteration...


Playlist...

we may need to go back and forth from the current idx
inform we reached the end of the playlist


First I may use SET DS/Array.

but eventually , I may decide to impleent with DLL.


now the client code may change on what DS we are using..


SO to remove this dependency we ca use ITERATOR, we will give an User interface to go to next song and prev song..
