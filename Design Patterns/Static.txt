What does static mean?
It means: "This thing belongs to the class, not the object."


You have a classroom of students. Normally, each student has their own notebook.
But now you say:

"Letâ€™s keep one shared whiteboard in the room."

That whiteboard = static variable
The notebooks = instance variables

You can access static stuff via class name: Student.totalStudents
