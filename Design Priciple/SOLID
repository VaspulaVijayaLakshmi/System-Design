S.O.L.I.D principles explained with examples:



S  -------   Single responsibility :  A class should have one and only one reason to change.

This keeps each class focused, improving maintainability.

A user class should not have :

User profile
User authentication
User ...


Instead it should have each class of its own





O -------- open / closed principle :


Inhertitance:

An object / entity  should be be open to extension but closed to modification
EG : A class can be inhertied, istead of making change to the class again and again(modification)



Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

 Bad: A ShapeCalculator class that requires modification every time a new shape is added.
 Better: Use a Shape base class and extend it with subclasses (Rectangle, Triangle, etc.). 
         Now, new shapes can be added without modifying existing code.






L ------  Liskov substituion principle


Overriding


Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses.

 Bad: A Bicycle class inheriting from Vehicle, but overriding a startEngine() method that makes no sense for bicycles.
 Better: Use a more general start() method in Vehicle. 





I --------   𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 (𝐈𝐒𝐏)


Interface 

- No client should be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. 

 Bad: A MediaPlayer interface that requires all implementations to support both audio and video, even when unnecessary.
 Better: Split into AudioPlayer and VideoPlayer interfaces. Now, classes implement only what they need, making the code more flexible.





D ----------   Dependency Injection


 High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
 Bad: An EmailService class that directly depends on a GmailClient  - Tight coupling

 Better: Introduce an EmailClient interface. 
 Now, EmailService depends on the abstraction  EMail Interface , allowing support for multiple providers (GmailClient, OutlookClient, etc.) without code changes


class GmailClient {
    public void sendEmail(String to, String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Gmail to " + to + ": " + message);
    }
}



class EmailService {
    private GmailClient gmailClient;

    public EmailService() {
        this.gmailClient = new GmailClient();  // Direct dependency
    }

    public void send(String to, String message) {
        gmailClient.sendEmail(to, message);
    }
}




_________________


interface EmailClient {
    void sendEmail(String to, String message);
}





class GmailClient implements EmailClient {
    public void sendEmail(String to, String message) {
        System.out.println("Gmail: " + to + " -> " + message);
    }
}

class OutlookClient implements EmailClient {
    public void sendEmail(String to, String message) {
        System.out.println("Outlook: " + to + " -> " + message);
    }
}






class EmailService {
    private EmailClient emailClient;

    // Dependency Injection via constructor
    public EmailService(EmailClient emailClient) {
        this.emailClient = emailClient;
    }

    public void send(String to, String message) {
        emailClient.sendEmail(to, message);
    }
}




public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmailClient client = new GmailClient(); // or new OutlookClient()
        EmailService service = new EmailService(client);
        service.send("user@example.com", "Hello from DIP!");
    }
}
