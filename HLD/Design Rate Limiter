RateLimiter - TO limit users from abusing resources.
Threshold on the number of requetss/user

Too Many reqests - 429 error


This is importnt along with timeouts and CBs

____________


Define in API gateways/LBs

_____________



-> Token Bucket :

Token comes into Bucket at constant rate   - and when a reqests comes it checks if a token is available then this rquest is executed
But if more requests come and bucket does not have a token its dicarded and can be put into queue  and retirned



DLQ - A DLQ is a special queue where messages go when they can’t be delivered or processed successfully after several attempts.
It prevents “poison messages” (bad data, corrupted payloads, unprocessable events) from clogging your main queue.




-> Leaky Bucket :

Bucket itself has a limit - and only tht many req it can hold say per sec.
SO each req from the bucket is removed and prcoessed.

Requets can be put in the bucket, once the bucket overflows, tht means we have reache dlimit and cant put requests , we can put them in queue and retyr.




-> Fixed WIndow : 

In each min, we define , a counter manatining the number of requests and in tht window we will prices son those

Bursts at boundary



-> Slinding Window :

We slide the window .








DESIGN



User -> API GATEWAY -> SERVICE


        we can store qeq counter in redis 
       or it can check if the user has enough token in their token bucket
