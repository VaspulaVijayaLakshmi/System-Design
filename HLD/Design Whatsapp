A user can send and receive text messages in real time.
When the user goes online, she receives all the messages that were addressed to her during her offline time.
By default, once a message is delivered to a user, it will be stored on the user's device and we no longer need to store them on the server (like WhatsApp and WeChat).
The users shouldn't see duplicate messages.
