Using event-driven architecture (EDA) for decoupled systems means designing your system so that different parts (or components) 
communicate by producing and responding to events, rather than calling each other directly (as in traditional, tightly coupled systems).

In simple terms:
Event: A record of something that happened (e.g., “OrderPlaced”, “UserSignedUp”).

Event producer: The part of the system that emits the event.

Event consumer: The part of the system that listens for and reacts to the event.



What this means for decoupling:


***     Components don't need to know about each other; they only need to know about the event.  *****

For example, an “Order Service” can emit an “OrderPlaced” event without caring who processes it. 
Separately, a “Shipping Service” can listen for that event and begin preparing the order.

This reduces dependencies, making the system more scalable, maintainable, and flexible.
